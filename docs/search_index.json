I hope my portfolio will show you how the world is rapidly changing with many powerful applications of machine learning and massive data we have accumulated over the years. I’m interested in computer algorithms and neural networks. If I am given the value of x and my ability to multiply it automatically to suit my need, do you consider that as an algorithm-driven robot or a self-conscious human being? We will explore more together with my idea on how much of a thing that a recent rise in powerful neural networks performance has sparked many applications in many fields such as facial recognition, voice recognition and including sentient machines.

About the author I am Kenneth Chen. My interest in machine learning and neural networks has roots in my earlier exposure to human biology and academic research. Previously I studied vesicle trafficking in cells and cancers-related human biology. Currently I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Rockefeller University where I typically manage microscopic images of 0.5TB in size by image processing and refinement by machine learning program.

["slug-one.html", "My first cool idea A beginning. A middle. An end.", " My first cool idea Author: Kenneth Chen Machine learning, sentient algorithms A sentient robot A beginning. If and only if could machines understand what we think. If consciousness is one of the fundamentals that make a difference between living species and machines, I wonder what about a flying bird? Do humans have consciousness of flying? What about other people’s mind? We can only imagine what other people think in their minds. One own’s consciousness can never be shared with others. There was never a visceral experience that can be gained from somebody else consciousness. In fact, experiences are derivatives based on one’s own personal experience. A middle. With regards to the statement above, we are now embarking upon an era of beginning of sentiment machine. Can machines think? Do machine have knowledge? With the development of multi-convoluted neural networks with a powerful capacity, sentient machine or bots can speak to each other in way that we have never imagined before. Recently in FAIR (Facebook AI Research) two bots were communicating in their own languagehttps://gizmodo.com/no-facebook-did-not-panic-and-shut-down-an-ai-program-1797414922. This sparks my idea of ‘sentient machine’. An end. With a sentient machine, we can deploy their utility in foster home and lonely people who just need a touch of human interaction. By providing what seems to be missing in their hearts, sentient machine can fulfill a part of our society and can establish themselves as a small domain. test((???)) test(Dehaene, Lau, and Kouider 2017) Does it work?

Recently there is a debate in scientific community if machine could ever develop consciousness. What defines consciousness?
