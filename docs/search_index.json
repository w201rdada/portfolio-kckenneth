I hope my portfolio will show you how the world is rapidly changing with many powerful applications of machine learning and massive data we have accumulated over the years. I am interested in computer algorithms and neural networks. If I am given the value of x and my ability to multiply it automatically to suit my need, do you consider that as an algorithm-driven robot or a self-conscious human being? We will explore more together with my idea on how much of a thing that a recent rise in powerful neural networks performance has sparked many applications in many fields such as facial recognition, voice recognition and including sentient machines. Figure 2: Robot or Human Building Sentiment by Powerful Neural Networks A simple classification of yes or no in neural network (NN) has existed since late 1950s. A single layered NN, a perceptron, has spawned many ideas of artificial intelligence (AI) possibilities in academic research. With a monumental progress in computing power and programming languages such as python and R, artifical neural network algorithms have developed into many versions of neural networks that can perform not only a binary classification but more complicated and complex patterns such as hand-written digits, facial contour features and many more. Sentient Robots If and only if could machines understand what we think. If consciousness is one of the fundamentals that make a difference between living species and machines, I wonder what about a flying bird? Do humans have consciousness of flying? What about other people’s mind? We can only imagine what other people think in their minds. One own’s consciousness can never be shared with others. There was never a visceral experience that can be gained from somebody else consciousness. In fact, experiences are derivatives based on one’s own personal experience. About the author I am Kenneth Chen. My interest in machine learning and neural networks has roots in my earlier exposure to human biology and academic research. Previously I studied vesicle trafficking in cells and cancers-related human biology. Currently I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Rockefeller University where I typically manage microscopic images of 0.5TB in size by image processing and refinement by machine learning program.

With regards to the statement above, we are now embarking upon an era of beginning of sentiment machine. Can machines think? Do machine have knowledge? With the development of multi-convoluted neural networks with a powerful capacity, sentient machine or bots can speak to each other in way that we have never imagined before. Recently in FAIR (Facebook AI Research) two bots were communicating in their own languagehttps://gizmodo.com/no-facebook-did-not-panic-and-shut-down-an-ai-program-1797414922. This sparks my idea of ‘sentient machine’. An end. With a sentient machine, we can deploy their utility in foster home and lonely people who just need a touch of human interaction. By providing what seems to be missing in their hearts, sentient machine can fulfill a part of our society and can establish themselves as a small domain. test((???)) test(Dehaene, Lau, and Kouider 2017) Does it work?

Recently there is a debate in scientific community if machine could ever develop consciousness. What defines consciousness? Authors Stanislas and colleagues claimed that it is not possible for machine to develop consciousness (Stanislas et al., 2007 Science) [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6362/486.full] A middle. 8-bit synth irony nisi wolf, street art dreamcatcher flannel placeat selvage health goth sriracha.
