I hope my portfolio will show you how the world is rapidly changing with many powerful applications of machine learning and massive data we have accumulated over the years. I am interested in computer algorithms and neural networks. If I am given the value of x and my ability to multiply it automatically to suit my need, do you consider that as an algorithm-driven robot or a self-conscious human being? We will explore more together with my idea on how much of a thing that a recent rise in powerful neural networks performance has sparked many applications in many fields such as facial recognition, voice recognition and including sentient machines. Figure 2: Robot or Human Building Sentiment by Powerful Neural Networks A simple classification of yes or no in neural network (NN) algorithm has existed since the late 1950s. A single layered NN, a perceptron, has spawned many ideas of artificial intelligence (AI) possibilities in academic research. With a monumental progress in computing power and programming languages such as python and R, artificial neural network algorithms have developed into many versions of neural networks that can perform not only a binary classification but more complicated and complex patterns such as hand-written digits, facial contour features and many more. Sentient Robots If and only if could machines understand what we think. If consciousness is one of the fundamentals that make a difference between living species and machines, I wonder what about a flying bird? Do humans have consciousness of flying? What about other people’s mind? We can only imagine what other people think in their minds. One own’s consciousness can never be shared with others. There was never a visceral experience that can be gained from somebody else consciousness. In fact, experiences are derivatives based on one’s own personal experience. Recently there is a debate on if conciousness can really be applied to machine(Dehaene, Lau, and Kouider 2017)(Carter et al. 2018). About me I am Kenneth Chen. My interest in machine learning and neural networks has roots in my earlier exposure to human biology and academic research. I did my doctoral dissertation in Cornell University. Currently I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Rockefeller University where I typically manage microscopic images of 0.5TB in size by image processing and refinement by machine learning program.

Utilities of Neural Network.", " Neural Networks Keywords Authors: Kenneth Chen Neural Networks and Consciousness. Recently there is a debate in scientific community if machine could ever develop consciousness. What defines consciousness? Authors Stanislas and colleagues claimed that it is not possible for machine to develop consciousness (Dehaene, Lau, and Kouider 2017). It’s hard to define consciousness when there are many domains that play a role in being conscious of something. It could be our being present at the moment, our ability to interact with surrounding, etc etc etc. Figure 3: Network The Game of Neural Network in Ancient Game. If we also look at the ancient game ‘Go’ where the number of possible ‘Go’ games is far more larger than all the atoms combined in the universe. The game has an intricacy of human cognitive abilities and strategic movement. The game stood the test of time for at least 3000 years. Now with a more powerful neural networks developed at Google Deepmind, AlphaGo has managed to beat the top player from South Korea, Lee Sedol two out of three games(Knapton 2017). This performance of convolutional neural networks has indeed piqued interest in many neural networks community. Recently without training a convolutional neural networks, the algorithm quickly learn and master the game of ‘Go’(Silver et al. 2017). Figure 4: Network Utilities of Neural Network. Facial recognition in smartphones, voice recognition in security checkpoint, retina scanning in medical checkup, all can be contributed to powerful neural network algorithm. Google neural network can now predict our health through retina scanning technology(“Google Neural Network Can Predict Your Health Status from Your Retina - ExtremeTech” 2018). If neural network can specialize in one domain, imagine a robot that has all the power of neural networks capability stored in its humanoid brain. References "],

If and only if could machines understand what we think. If consciousness is one of the fundamentals that make a difference between living species and machines, I wonder what about a flying bird? Do humans have consciousness of flying? What about other people’s mind? We can only imagine what other people think in their minds. One own’s consciousness can never be shared with others.

With regards to the statement above, we are now embarking upon an era of beginning of sentient machine. Can machines think? Do machine have knowledge? With the development of multi-convoluted neural networks with a powerful capacity, sentient machine or bots can speak to each other in way that we have never imagined before. Recently in FAIR (Facebook AI Research) two bots were communicating in their own language(McKay 2018). Figure 6: Network Future. With a sentient machine, we can deploy their utility in foster home and lonely people who just need a touch of human interaction. By providing what seems to be missing in their hearts, sentient machine can fulfill a part of our society and can establish themselves as a small domain. There have been a few studies where interaction with human like machines improve cognitive ability of elderly in foster home(Zhuang et al. 2013). In Japan, nurses-like robots are taking place in hospitals(“Japan Prefers Robot Bears to Foreign Nurses” 2018)(Osborne 2018). "]
