#### Machine learning, sentient algorithms

A sentient robot

## A beginning.

If and only if could machine understand what we think ... we always wonder. What about other people's mind? We can only conjecture what other people thinks in their minds. That their physical sense and any kind of being sentient can be mutually understood can only be extrapolated from one's own experience. There was never a visceral experience that can be gained from somebody else sentiment. There was only an understanding that is a derivative.

## A middle.

With regards to the statement above, we are now embarking upon an era of beginning of sentiment machine. Can machines think? Do machine have knowledge? With the development of multi-convoluted neural networks with a powerful capacity, sentient machine or bots can speak to each other in way that we have never imagined before. Recently in FAIR (Facebook AI Research) two bots were communicating in their own language<https://gizmodo.com/no-facebook-did-not-panic-and-shut-down-an-ai-program-1797414922>. This sparks my idea of 'sentient machine'. 

## An end.

With a sentient machine, we can deploy their utility in foster home and lonely people who just need a touch of human interaction. By providing what seems to be missing in their hearts, sentient machine can fulfill a part of our society and can establish themselves as a small domain.
