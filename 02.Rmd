#### "Friends" indeed when in need with sentient algorithms

A sentient robot

## Introduction.

Social interaction is a fundamental foundation of all humans well-being. Isolation from a social community or lack of social interaction can lead to severe depression and mental illness. With ever increasing demand of work for younger adults and professionals alike, elderly and younger people find themselves ever lacking in proper development of social behavior which can lead to depression and further isolation from social network. With a development of sentient algorithm, we can provide something useful to the society that needs someone who can understand their needs in time.

```{r hello-humanoid,echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Network',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/humanoid.jpg')
```

## Application.

A robot that can understand your feelings, that can retrieve information for your question, and even provide useful knowledge to your daily well-being. Imagine the robot that you once had a conversation and happened to mention "I once had an arthritis", will remind you next time "Be careful of the steps, bring some medications for your health." when you mention that you're going for a hiking. A personal friend who look out for your medical condition. Or when you need a healthy conversation with your friend, you can express your opinion without worrying about any harm befallen upon you in the future. With regards to the statement above, we are now embarking upon an era of beginning of sentient machine or specifically sentient algorithm. Can machines think? Do machine have knowledge? With the development of multi-convoluted neural networks with a powerful capacity, sentient machine or bots can speak to each other in way that we have never imagined before. Recently in FAIR (Facebook AI Research) two bots were communicating in their own language[@mckay_no_nodate].

```

## Future.

With a sentient machine, we can deploy their utility in foster home and lonely people who just need a touch of human interaction. By providing what seems to be missing in their hearts, sentient machine can fulfill a part of our society and can establish themselves as a small domain. There have been a few studies where interaction with human like machines improve cognitive ability of elderly in foster home[@zhuang_impact_2013]. In Japan, nurses-like robots are taking place in hospitals[@noauthor_japan_nodate][@osborne_robots_nodate].
