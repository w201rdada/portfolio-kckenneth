How are you doing? I hope my portfolio will show you how the world is rapidly changing with many powerful applications of machine learning and massive data we have accumulated over the years. I am interested in computer algorithms and neural networks. If I am given the value of x and my ability to multiply it automatically to suit my need, do you consider that as an algorithm-driven robot or a self-conscious human being? We will explore more together with my idea on how much of a thing that a recent rise in powerful neural networks performance has sparked many applications in many fields such as facial recognition, voice recognition and including sentient machines.

### Abstract of my first cool idea {-}

A simple classification of yes or no in neural network (NN) has existed since late 1950s. A single layered NN, a perceptron, has spawned many ideas of artificial intelligence (AI) possibilities in academic research. With a monumental progress in computing power and programming languages such as python and R, artifical neural network algorithms have developed into many versions of neural networks that can perform not only a binary classification but more complicated and complex patterns such as hand-written digits, facial contour features and many more.

## About the author {-}

I am Kenneth Chen. My interest in machine learning and neural networks has roots in my earlier exposure to human biology and academic research. Previously I studied vesicle trafficking in cells and cancers-related human biology. Currently I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Rockefeller University where I typically manage microscopic images of 0.5TB in size by image processing and refinement by machine learning program.
