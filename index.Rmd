How are you doing? I hope my portfolio will show you how the world is rapidly changing with many powerful applications of machine learning and massive data we have accumulated over the years. I'm interested in computer algorithms and neural networks. If I am given the value of x and my ability to multiply it automatically to suit my need, do you consider that as an algorithm-driven robot or a self-conscious human being? We will explore more together with my idea on how much of a thing that a recent rise in powerful neural networks performance has sparked many applications in many fields such as facial recognition, voice recognition and including sentient machines.

## About the author {-}

I am Kenneth Chen. My interest in machine learning and neural networks has roots in my earlier exposure to human biology and academic research. Previously I studied vesicle trafficking in cells and cancers-related human biology. Currently I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Rockefeller University where I typically manage microscopic images of 0.5TB in size by image processing and refinement by machine learning program.
